# üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

This project detects malicious network traffic using a Random Forest model trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Wireshark (for packet capture)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works
1. Dataset is preprocessed
2. Model is trained using Random Forest
3. New traffic can be analyzed and classified as safe or malicious

## How to Run
- Clone the repo or download the files
- Open `ids_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
- Run all the cells step by step

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it! You now have a working IDS using machine learning.
